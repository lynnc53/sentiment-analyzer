# Sentiment Analyzer  
This project builds a text classification model that predicts sentiment (Positive or Negative) from movie review data using traditional NLP and machine learning techniques.

## Goals
- Explore classical NLP techniques using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression
- Build a lightweight and interpretable sentiment classifier
- Develop a simple frontend for user interaction (via CLI or Streamlit)

## Stack
- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, scikit-learn, NLTK, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Interface**: Streamlit for web-based UI, CLI option via `sentiment_cli.py`
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and visualization

## Status
- ✔️ Project initialized
- ✔️ Dataset loaded, cleaned, and saved
- ✔️ Features extracted (TF-IDF) and model trained
- ✔️ Inference pipeline created
- ✔️ Streamlit interface deployed

## To run the app
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Streamlit UI
streamlit run app.py
